|----------------|:--------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Sample type         Probability sample           |   |  Stratified random sampling from Canadian voters, ensuring representation across key demographic groups (age, region, etc.).                                           |   Stratified random sampling from Canadian voters, ensuring representation across key demographic groups (age, region, etc.).    |Observational study with field-based data collection
| Sample size   |  Approximately 20,000 respondents (across Canada)   |  Approximately 10,000 respondents.  |   Data gathered from multiple observations of individual bats over time, typically fewer than 100 individuals (exact sample size not always stated, as it varies based on the study).                                                                                      |
| Target population |  election  All Canadian adults aged 15 and older who reside in private households.  |  Canadian citizens aged 18 and older who were eligible to vote in the 2019 Canadian federal                           | Glossophaga soricina (the long-tongued bat), a species found in Central and South America.        |
| Sampling frame       The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the sampling frame for this survey, which includes a list of private households in Canada. Some individuals living on reserves and in institutional settings are excluded.          |  A national online panel of Canadian voters, often recruited through a variety of means including academic institutions and research organizations. The panel is built from voter lists and online platforms.    |      The specific geographic areas where the bats are found, and observation sites (such as feeding grounds or caves).                                       |                                                                                             |
| Survey mode(s)  |  The survey uses telephone interviews (CATI) and self-administered online surveys. The telephone interviews are the primary mode of data collection, though there is an option for online responses in some cases                              |  The survey is conducted online, with respondents recruited through various channels ( email, social media).  |  The fieldwork was conducted between January and December 2018. |
| Timeline                                              |    The fieldwork was conducted between January and December 2018.    | The fieldwork was conducted during the election period in 2019, starting before the election and continuing through the election day and its aftermath.                                            | Fieldwork typically conducted over several months or years to observe seasonal changes in feeding behavior and niche flexibility.                                                                                            |
| Response rate        |Around 50% (a typical response rate for large-scale Canadian national surveys).       |  Varies, but online surveys typically experience lower response rates than traditional surveys (likely between 10-20%). The exact rate would depend on recruitment efforts and panel size                 |  Not applicable in observational studies. However, the rate of bat sightings or capture can influence the sample size.                                                                                           |
| Weights        |  Data is weighted to be representative of the Canadian adult population. Weights adjust for non-response and ensure that the sample accurately reflects the demographic characteristics of the population (age, gender, province, etc.).     | The data is weighted to adjust for demographic imbalances and non-response bias (e.g., underrepresentation of certain age or income groups).   |   Weights are typically not applied to observational studies of this nature. However, data might be weighted if different ecological conditions (e.g., different environments) are compared.                                                                                          |
| Data processing            |  Data from interviews and online responses are processed and coded. For telephone interviews, responses are directly recorded and cleaned for inconsistencies.    |  The responses are coded and categorized according to political affiliations, voting intentions, etc. Online survey platforms often process and clean the data automatically.     |  Field data is recorded in natural settings and analyzed for feeding behavior. This might involve cataloging the species of nectar plants and insects consumed by bats.                                                                                           |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc.   |   Imputation methods are used for missing data, especially for non-responses on specific questions. Where feasible, responses are edited and verified for consistency.    |  Imputation is used to handle missing data, typically replacing missing answers with statistically predicted values based on other responses.   |    Data may be cleaned to ensure consistency and to remove any outliers or errors in observation, though imputation is not typically used.                                                                                         |
| Sources of error    | Sampling error due to the exclusion of some populations        |   Sampling error, as the online sample may not be fully representative of the broader Canadian electorate     |  Observation bias (e.g., difficulty in observing bats at night), sampling bias (e.g., some individuals may not be captured or observed), and seasonal variations affecting feeding behavior.          |
| Limitations, known biases        |       The survey might under-represent some groups (e.g., younger adults or certain ethnic communities). Non-response bias could affect the reliability of the data.
Responses might be biased due to social desirability (people may underreport or overreport volunteering and giving behaviors).     |   The online nature of the survey may exclude individuals who do not have internet access or who do not regularly participate in online surveys.
Non-response bias may occur if certain political groups or demographic groups are less likely to respond    |      The study might not be fully representative of all Glossophaga soricina populations, as behavior can vary based on region or time of year. Additionally, observational studies are inherently limited by the possibility of missing data (some feeding events may go unobserved).                                                                                       |
