# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios

1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

Survey Design for Scenario: Relationship Between Music Taste and Age

Describe the purpose of your survey:
The purpose of this survey  is to explore how music taste, 
particularly the perception of popular music, changes with age. The study aims to identify 
patterns in music preferences across age groups and how personal tastes evolve over an 
individual's lifetime. The results will inform a sociology research paper on the influence
of age on musical preferences.


Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
Target Population, Sampling Frame, Sampling Units, and Sampling Strategy

Target Population: Individuals aged 19 and older across diverse age groups and backgrounds who are familiar with popular music.
Sampling Frame: Current students, alumni, and faculty at the University of Toronto, as well as members of online communities and social media groups related to music and sociology.
Sampling Units: Individual respondents within the target population who consent to participate.
Sampling Strategy: Stratified sampling by age group to ensure representation across different age brackets (age group : 19-24, 25-34, 35-44, etc.). Recruitment through university channels and music-related online communities.
